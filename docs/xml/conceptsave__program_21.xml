<para>YAP can save and read images of its current state to files, known as saved states. </para>

    <detaileddescription>
<para>It is possible to save the entire state or just a module or a file Notice that saved states in YAP depend on the architecture where they were made, and may also depend on the version of YAP being saved</para>
<para>YAP always tries to find saved states from the current directory first If it cannot it will use the environment variable YAPLIBDIR, if defined, or search the default library directory</para>
<para><bold>save_program</bold>(+ <emphasis>F</emphasis>) Saves the current state of the data-base in file <emphasis>F</emphasis></para>
<para>The result is a resource archive containing a saved state that expresses all Prolog data from the running program and all user-defined resources Depending on the stand_alone option, the resource is headed by the emulator, a Unix shell script or nothing</para>
