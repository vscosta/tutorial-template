<para><bold>load_db</bold>( +Files )</para>
<para>Load a database of ground facts All facts must take up the same amount of storage, so that a fact $I$ can be accessed at position <emphasis>P[I-1]</emphasis> This representation thus stores the facts as a huge continuous array, the so-called mega clause</para>
<para>See for a motivation for this technique YAP implements this optimization by default whenever it loads a large number of facts (see Yap_BuildMegaClause(PredEntry *ap) ) for the details On the other hand, loading the data-base will cause fragmentation because individual facts facts need extra headers ands tails, and because often new atoms will be stored in the Symbol Table, see LookupAtom(const char *atom) The main advantage of <ref refid="classload__db_21" kindref="compound">load_db/1</ref> is that it allocates the necessary memory only once Just doing this may halve total memory usage in large in-memory database-oriented applications</para>

</simplesect>
YAP implements <ref refid="classload__db_21" kindref="compound">load_db/1</ref> as a two-step non-optimised process First, it counts the nmuber of facts and checks their size Second, it allocates and fills the memory The first step of the algorithm is implemented by dbload_get_space(), and the second by dbload_add_facts()</para>
<para>db_files/1 itself is just a call to <ref refid="classload__files_22" kindref="compound">load_files/2</ref></para>
<para>properties: deterministic</para>
<para>Load files each one containing as single predicare composed of facts with the same size </para>
