    <title>The Clausal Data Base</title>
    <briefdescription>
<para>Predicates in YAP may be dynamic or static. </para>
    </briefdescription>
    <detaileddescription>
<para>Next follow the main operations on dynamic predicates.</para>
<para>By default, when consulting or reconsulting, predicates are assumed to be static: execution is faster and the code will probably use less space Static predicates impose some restrictions: in general there can be no addition or removal of clauses for a procedure if it is being used in the current execution</para>
<para>Dynamic predicates allow programmers to change the Clausal Data Base with the same flexibility as in C-Prolog With dynamic predicates it is always possible to add or remove clauses during execution and the semantics will be the same as for C-Prolog But the programmer should be aware of the fact that asserting or retracting are still expensive operations, and therefore he should try to avoid them whenever possible</para>
