<para>Predicates compiled with YAP&apos;s flag call_counting set to <computeroutput>on</computeroutput> update counters on the numbers of calls and of retries Counters are actually decreasing counters, so that they can be used as timers Three counters are available:</para>
<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><computeroutput>calls</computeroutput>: number of predicate calls since execution started or since system was reset;</para>
</listitem><listitem><para><computeroutput>retries</computeroutput>: number of retries for predicates called since execution started or since counters were reset;</para>
</listitem><listitem><para><computeroutput>calls_and_retries</computeroutput>: count both on predicate calls and retries</para>
</listitem></itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>These counters can be used to find out how many calls a certain goal takes to execute They can also be used as timers</para>
<para>The code for the call counters piggybacks on the profiling code Therefore, activating the call counters also activates the profiling counters</para>
<para>These are the predicates that access and manipulate the call counters</para>
