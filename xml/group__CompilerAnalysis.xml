    <title>Internal Clause Rewriting</title>
    <briefdescription>
<para>YAP supports several clause optimisation mechanisms, that are designed to improve execution of arithmetic and term construction built-ins. </para>
    </briefdescription>
    <detaileddescription>
<para>In other words, during the compilation process a clause is rewritten twice:</para>
<para><orderedlist>
<listitem><para>first, perform user-defined goal_expansion as described in the predicates goal_expansion/1 and goal_expansion/2</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>Perform expansion of some built-ins like:<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>pruning operators, like -&gt;/2 and F&gt;/2</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>arithmetic, including early evaluation of constant expressions</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>specialise versions for some built-ins, if we are aware of the run-time execution mode</para>
</listitem></itemizedlist>
</para>
</listitem></orderedlist>
</para>
<para>The user has some control over this process, through some built-ins and through execution flsgs</para>
