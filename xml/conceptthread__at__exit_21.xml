<para>Run <emphasis>Goal</emphasis> just before releasing the thread resources This is to be compared to <computeroutput>at_halt/1 </computeroutput>, but only for the current thread These hooks are ran regardless of why the execution of the thread has been completed As these hooks are run, the return-code is already available through <ref refid="classthread__property_22" kindref="compound">thread_property/2</ref> using the result of <ref refid="classthread__self_21" kindref="compound">thread_self/1</ref> as thread-identifier If you want to guarantee the execution of an exit hook no matter how the thread terminates (the thread can be aborted before reaching the <ref refid="classthread__at__exit_21" kindref="compound">thread_at_exit/1</ref> call), consider using instead the <computeroutput>at_exit/1 </computeroutput> option of <ref refid="classthread__create_23" kindref="compound">thread_create/3</ref> </para>
