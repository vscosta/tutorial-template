<para>% returns the current set of Key-Datum pairs in the Heap as a List, sorted into ascending order of Keys This is included simply because I think every data structure foo ought to have a foo_to_list and list_to_foo relation (where, of course, it makes sense!) so that conversion between arbitrary data structures is as easy as possible This predicate is basically just a merge sort, where we can exploit the fact that the tops of the subtrees are smaller than their descendants </para>
