<para>If <emphasis>S</emphasis> is a currently opened stream for output, it becomes the current output stream If <emphasis>S</emphasis> is an atom it is taken to be a filename If there is no output stream currently associated with it, then it is opened for output in <emphasis>append</emphasis> mode, that is, by adding new data to the end of the file The new output stream created becomes the current output stream If it is not possible to open the file, an error occurs If there is a single opened output stream currently associated with the file, then it becomes the current output stream; if there are more than one in that condition, one of them is chosen</para>
<para>Whenever <emphasis>S</emphasis> is a stream not currently opened for output, an error may be reported, depending on the state of the file_errors flag The predicate just fails, if <emphasis>S</emphasis> is neither a stream nor an atom </para>
