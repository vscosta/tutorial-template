<para>Sets or reads the default tabling mode for a tabled predicate <emphasis>P</emphasis> (or a list of predicates <emphasis>P1</emphasis>,..., <emphasis>Pn</emphasis> or [ <emphasis>P1</emphasis>,..., <emphasis>Pn</emphasis>]) The list of <emphasis>Mode</emphasis> options includes:</para>
<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><computeroutput>batched</computeroutput></para>
<para>Defines that, by default, batched scheduling is the scheduling strategy to be used to evaluated calls to predicate <emphasis>P</emphasis></para>
</listitem><listitem><para><computeroutput>local</computeroutput></para>
<para>Defines that, by default, local scheduling is the scheduling strategy to be used to evaluated calls to predicate <emphasis>P</emphasis></para>
</listitem><listitem><para><computeroutput>exec_answers</computeroutput></para>
<para>Defines that, by default, when a call to predicate <emphasis>P</emphasis> is already evaluated (completed), answers are obtained by executing compiled WAM-like code directly from the trie data structure This reduces the loading time when backtracking, but the order in which answers are obtained is undefined</para>
</listitem><listitem><para><computeroutput>load_answers</computeroutput></para>
<para>Defines that, by default, when a call to predicate <emphasis>P</emphasis> is already evaluated (completed), answers are obtained (as a consumer) by loading them from the trie data structure This guarantees that answers are obtained in the same order as they were found Somewhat less efficient but creates less choice-points</para>
</listitem></itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>The default tabling mode for a new tabled predicate is <computeroutput>batched</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>exec_answers</computeroutput> To set the tabling mode for all predicates at once you can use the <ref refid="classyap__flag_22" kindref="compound">yap_flag/2</ref> predicate as described next </para>
